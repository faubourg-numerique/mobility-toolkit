This directory contains the configuration for data collection for each user.
It is under analysis because the configuration can be a combination of:
- user specification
- server side overrides
- what we think is best for gathering most information

Right now, we allow the user to specify all the parameters in the input object.
But later, we may allow them to specify policy and not mechanism and adjust the
detailed parameters ourselves.
